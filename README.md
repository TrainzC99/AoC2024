# General

* Here lie my solutions for AoC 2024.
* AoC = Advent of Code 2024

# Organisation

* Each day will have its own branch.
* At the end of December all branches will be merged to main.
* On Sinterklaas/Saint Nicholas/Moș Nicolae, Kerstmis/Christmas/Crăciun and
Oudejaarsavond/New Year's eve/Ajunul Anului Nou tags will be created. This will
simply mark the progress at that point in time.


## DAY1
- So far I am waiting for the problem to be published. To my suprise, the origin
of the website is located at UTC-5 which makes it 6h behind my current NL time.
I guess I am waking up early. You know ... "Rise and shine, Mr. Freeman ... rise
and shine" ... "early bird catches the worm" ... so on and so forth.

- I have jsut opened the problem, let's see what it is about.
