<li>Here lie my solutions for AoC 2024.</li>
<li>AoC = Advent of Code 2024</li>
</ul>
<h1>Organisation</h1>
<ul>
<li>Each day will have its own branch.</li>
<li>At the end of December all branches will be merged to main.</li>
<li>On Sinterklaas/Saint Nicholas/Moș Nicolae, Kerstmis/Christmas/Crăciun and
Oudejaarsavond/New Year's eve/Ajunul Anului Nou tags will be created. This will
simply mark the progress at that point in time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>DAY1</h2>
<ul>
<li>So far I am waiting for the problem to be published. To my suprise, the origin
of the website is located at UTC-5 which makes it 6h behind my current NL time.
I guess I am waking up early. You know ... &quot;Rise and shine, Mr. Freeman ... rise
and shine&quot; ... &quot;early bird catches the worm&quot; ... so on and so forth.</li>
