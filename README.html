<li>Here lie my solutions for AoC 2024.</li>
<li>AoC = Advent of Code 2024</li>
</ul>
<h1>Organisation</h1>
<ul>
<li>Each day will have its own branch.</li>
<li>At the end of December all branches will be merged to main.</li>
<li>On Sinterklaas/Saint Nicholas/Moș Nicolae, Kerstmis/Christmas/Crăciun and
Oudejaarsavond/New Year's eve/Ajunul Anului Nou tags will be created. This will
simply mark the progress at that point in time.</li>

<h2>DAY1</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>So far I am waiting for the problem to be published. To my suprise, the origin
of the website is located at UTC-5 which makes it 6h behind my current NL time.
I guess I am waking up early. You know ... &quot;Rise and shine, Mr. Freeman ... rise
and shine&quot; ... &quot;early bird catches the worm&quot; ... so on and so forth.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I have jsut opened the problem, let's see what it is about.</p>

<h2>DAY2</h2>
<p>This day proved to be more difficult than it looked. It showed me that I have
gotten rusty at programming and algorithms. Anyhow, after a long battle of a
few days, I managed to beat it. Huraaay !. As a resolution, I think I should try
more of these challenges, so that I can get better at it and restore my once
owned glory.</p>
<p>As far as the parts of this challange are concearned, the description of my
solution can be found in the commits. This has been brought to my attention that
it mat not be a desoired approach for documenting. And indeed it isn't. You have
to click many times and look in many places to piece together my solution.
Rather than looking in one place. Maybe I will change this in future branches.</p>
